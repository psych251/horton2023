If fairness is defined as strict equality, then Option 2 would be preferable, as both Person A and Person B would receive the same amount.

If fairness is defined as proportionality, where rewards are distributed based on input or contribution, then Option 1 might be preferable. Person A is receiving twice the amount as Person B, which could be seen as a fair distribution if Person A has contributed or performed better.

Assuming both Person A and Person B are important to me and their well-being is of equal importance, Option 1 would likely be the fairer choice. In this case, both individuals receive an equal payout of $400, which can contribute to a more balanced distribution of resources.

On the other hand, Option 2 results in Person A receiving less than Person B. While this option may benefit me financially (if I were a person), it may not be considered fair or equitable to Person A, who is receiving a smaller payout compared to Person B.

Ultimately, the best choice depends on various factors, such as the specific circumstances and the agreement or fairness principles that are applied."
